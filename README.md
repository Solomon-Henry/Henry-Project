Project's Title: "Apex Adventures: Mad Maggie"

Project's Premise: Survival in bloodsport competition in the future year of 2700s, in the fictional universe of Apex Legends

Project's Description - This is Solomon Henry's project 1 - Game Version 0.1 for the class of CMPT 120. In this project, I will make an interactive text adventure in the style of Zork. This story is to take place in the universe of my favorite game "Apex Legends", with the protagonist being the imprisoned warlord "Mad Maggie". The basic premise of this adventure is that Mad Maggie has been sentenced to fight again and again in the Apex Games, a bloodsport competition where squads of 3 battle to the death, until she is eventually killed with no chance of revival. But it will take a lot more than the Apex Legends, returning champions of the Apex Games, to put this warlord down.
